    "## More Details on `GraphSchema`\n",
    "Below are more details on how the graph-nd internal `GraphSchema` works and the modeling assumptions it makes.  It has specific opinions and limitations to help with automated retrieval tool design and data loading - though these are subject to change in the future as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `GraphSchema` Assumptions & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A GraphSchema is composed of three elements\n",
    "    1. an optional description\n",
    "    2. a list of NodeSchemas\n",
    "    3. a list of relationshipSchemas\n",
    "2. There can be only one node schema per node label and one relationship schema per relationship type.\n",
    "3. Both nodes and relationships can have any number of properties\n",
    "4. Only properties with types `ALLOWED_PROPERTY_TYPES = {\"STRING\", \"INTEGER\", \"FLOAT\", \"BOOLEAN\", \"DATE\", \"DATE_TIME\"}` can be considered\n",
    "5. No methods in `graphrag.schema.*` assume any write permissions to the database (technically only [`reader`](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/built-in-roles/#access-control-built-in-roles-reader) permissions are assumed), meaning that no indexes or constraints can be set while creating schemas. They are instead checked and created if needed when writing data via `graphrag.data.*` methods. In general ONLY `graphrag.data.*` methods attempt writes and index/constraint setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Node Schema Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "1. Every node label must have one id property (non-composite) which is assumed to uniquely identify nodes of that label.\n",
    "    - This id property is required whenever loading nodes and relationships regardless of source (structured or unstructured)\n",
    "    - in general elements (nodes and rels) are merged on unique id property(ies).\n",
    "2. Vector and full text indexes are supported per node label through `searchFields` owned by the individual `NodeSchema`\n",
    "3. Multi-label and multi-property vector/fulltext indexes are not currently supported. You can only use vector and full text indexes that are set on one node label and one node property.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relationship Schema Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "1.  Vector and full text indexes are not currently supported for relationship properties\n",
    "2.  relationships have a list of one or more `queryPatterns`. A `queryPattern` is composed of a start and end node label.  The `queryPatterns` in a `RelationshipSchema` dictate which node labels a relationship can exist in between.\n",
    "3. relationships have an *optional* id property which if provided is used to identify relationships for the purpose of maintaining parallel relationships (more than one instance of relationships of the same type existing between the same start and nodes).  If this id isn't provided repeat instances will be merged into the same single relationship when loading data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `GraphSchema` Opinions When Using `graphrag.schema.from_existing_graph()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming Conventions & Exclusions\n",
    "1. By default properties, labels and rel types leading with an underscore `_` or space ` ` are ignored.\n",
    "    - Users can customize prefix, and exact match exclusion criteria across properties, labels, and relationships\n",
    "    - `INFO` message on exclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Node Label & Id\n",
    "1. multi-labels are not considered.  If multi-labels are encountered they are treated as separate nodes.\n",
    "2. node ids should have a non-composite uniqueness constraint on a property of `ALLOWED_PROPERTY_TYPES`. if multiple found then use `tie-break` logic. If non are found then the following fallback methods are tried in order.\n",
    "     - `WARNING` must be thrown explaining fallback choices, not falling in `ALLOWED_PROPERTY_TYPES`, and tie breaking if it happens\n",
    "     - fallback methods\n",
    "       1. Look for properties with range indexes.  if found, choose the one with highest unique count. If ties, use `tie-break` logic\n",
    "       2. Else find properties with highest unique count. If ties, use `tie-break` logic\n",
    "       3. Else if no properties the node label must be ignored\n",
    "     - `tie-break` logic: choose the shortest named property (i.e. between a property \"id\" and \"name\" - \"id\" would be chosen since it only has 2 chars vs 4). If same length choose first name in ascending sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Node Properties\n",
    "1. properties which have a vector index will be excluded from property lists. This is to avoid them being returned to LLMs in retrieval and blowing context windows. They can be taken into account later with search fields which is a separate part of graph schema to inform vector search & retrieval\n",
    "    - These are silently excluded\n",
    "2. Only properties with types `ALLOWED_PROPERTY_TYPES` can be considered\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Node Search Fields\n",
    "1. Only FULLTEXT and TEXTEMBEDDING will be considered\n",
    "2. for full text indexes it must be true that the property is included (from above) and the property has a full text index on it\n",
    "3. For TEXTEMBEDDING this is more complicated because Neo4j does not associate the text embedding property to the field it was calculated from\n",
    "    1. The ser must specify what indexes and pproeprties to include as text embedding search fields through the `text_embed_index_map` argument.\n",
    "    2. If the vector index corresponding isn't found an `ERROR` is thrown\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relationship TYPE and Id\n",
    "1. Only Relationship Types between included nodes (above) will be included\n",
    "2. Relationship Ids (for parallel relationships) cannot be inferred and will be assumed `None` unless users provide them through the `parallel_rel_ids` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relationship Properties\n",
    "1. properties which have a vector index will be excluded from property lists. This is to avoid them being returned to LLMs in retrieval and blowing context windows.\n",
    "     - These are silently excluded\n",
    "2. Only properties with types `ALLOWED_PROPERTY_TYPES` can be considered\n",
