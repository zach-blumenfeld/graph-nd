Dopants, such as boron, aluminum, phosphorous, platinum or other elements, may be added to alter the level of semiconductivity. 300 mm wafers, produced by Japanese, Taiwanese, German, and Korean firms, are used to produce nearly all advanced chips today.

This produces the familiar look of a dark gray rectangle with metal pins at the edges.\",\n",
