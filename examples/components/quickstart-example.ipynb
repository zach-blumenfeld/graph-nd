To produce them, a furnace forms a cylinder of silicon (or other semiconducting materials), which is then cut into disc-shaped wafers. These wafers are then processed, split and packaged into individual chips. Most wafers are made purely of silicon or another material, but others have more complex structures. Dopants, such as boron, aluminum, phosphorous, platinum or other elements, may be added to alter the level of semiconductivity. 300 mm wafers, produced by Japanese, Taiwanese, German, and Korean firms, are used to produce nearly all advanced chips today. Manufacturing the smoothest, high-purity 300 mm wafers-which are necessary for supporting the smallest chip feature sizes-requires considerable tacit know-how. Older-technology wafer sizes include 150 and 200 mm, used for chips with larger feature sizes.\",\n",

Photolithography scanners use ultraviolet light to draw intricate, nanoscale patterns into semiconductor wafers, creating the billions of tiny circuits contained in a single advanced logic chip. An extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scanner refracts a beam of 13.5 nm ultraviolet light through a photomask, transferring that pattern to a photoresist chemical applied as a layer on the chip. The light dissolves parts of the photoresist in the circuit pattern. The newly created photoresist pattern is etched into a permanent chip substrate below the photoresist.

    "- transformType: How the data was transformed from source and if it involved an LLM, i.e. \"LLM_TEXT_EXTRACTION_TO_NODES\", \"TABLE_MAPPING_TO_NODE\" (the presence of \"LLM\" implies an LLM was used)\n",

    "    - If set to `True`, default source metadata is prepared and added to a `__Source__` node in the graph.\n",
    "    A `__source_id` property is added and/or appended to each node which maps to the id property of `__Source__` node\n",
    "    - If `False`, no source metadata is added to the graph.\n",

    "`__Source__` has no relationships to other nodes.  You can only match connection through the shared id in the `__source_id` property.  This decision was purposeful, though open to change in later revisions.  For one, relationships may have a smaller set of sources then the nodes they connect to, and there isn't a simple way to connect relationships to other relationships.  The other bigger reason was to avoid bad text2Cypher queries that may unknowing and erroneously traverse over `__Source__` nodes to explode context windows or retrieve bad info. Finally, and this is more of a personal opinion, the UX feels much cleaner in Neo4j tools like Query and Explore. You avoid super node hairballs, the schema visualizations are easier to understand, etc.\n",
